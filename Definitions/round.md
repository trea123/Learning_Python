The `round` function in Python is a built-in tool that helps with rounding numbers. It's pretty straightforward to use and takes two inputs. The first input is a number that you want to round, and you must include it. The second input is optional, and it's used to determine the number of decimal places you want to round to. If you don't provide the second input, the function will round the number to the nearest whole number. But if you give it a whole number as the second input, it will round the number to that specific number of decimal places. It's pretty handy when you need to work with numbers and want to control how they get rounded.

```
round(number, ndigits=None)
    Round a number to a given precision in decimal digits.

    The return value is an integer if ndigits is omitted or None.
    - Otherwise -
    The return value has the same type as the number.
    (ndigits may be negative)
```

Here are some simple examples of using the `round` function in Python:

1. Basic rounding to the nearest whole number:
```python
number = 3.75
rounded_number = round(number)
print(rounded_number)  # Output: 4
```

2. Rounding to a specific number of decimal places:
```python
number = 2.34567
rounded_number = round(number, 2)  # Round to 2 decimal places
print(rounded_number)  # Output: 2.35
```

3. Rounding to the nearest 10:
```python
number = 47
rounded_number = round(number, -1)  # Round to the nearest 10
print(rounded_number)  # Output: 50
```

4. Using `round` with negative numbers:
```python
number = -1.234
rounded_number = round(number, 2)  # Round to 2 decimal places
print(rounded_number)  # Output: -1.23
```

5. Rounding large numbers:
```python
large_number = 1234567890.123456789
rounded_number = round(large_number, 4)  # Round to 4 decimal places
print(rounded_number)  # Output: 1234567890.1235
```

Remember that the `round` function returns a float, so if you need the result as an integer, you can explicitly convert it using `int()`:

```python
number = 3.75
rounded_number = int(round(number))
print(rounded_number)  # Output: 4
```
