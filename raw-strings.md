# Raw Strings

In Python, a raw string is a string that is prefixed with the letter `r` (or `R`). When you create a raw string, backslashes `\` are treated as literal characters rather than escape characters. This means that escape sequences like `\n` for newline or `\t` for tab are not interpreted and are considered as regular characters.

For example:

```python
normal_string = "Hello\nWorld"  # This will have a newline between Hello and World when printed.
raw_string = r"Hello\nWorld"  # This will not interpret \n as a newline and will have \n in the output when printed.
```

Raw strings are useful in scenarios where you want to include paths, regular expressions, or any other strings that contain many backslashes. They help avoid confusion and reduce the need for double escaping backslashes, making the code more readable and straightforward.
