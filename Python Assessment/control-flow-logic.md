# Control Flow Logic

Here are some questions that could help gauge your understanding of control flow structures in Python, such as conditional statements and loops:

## Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)

1. *How does Python’s syntax for if-elif-else differ from other programming languages you are familiar with?*

---

2. *Can you explain the concept of nested if statements?*

---

3. *Can you write a Python conditional statement that checks whether a variable is positive, negative, or zero?*

---

4. *How does Python treat non-boolean conditions in an if statement, for example a string or a list?*

---


## For Loops

1. *How would you iterate over a list in Python and print each element?*

---

2. *Can you explain the range function and how it can be used in a for loop?*
---

3. *How would you iterate over a dictionary in Python? How about iterating over it in sorted order?*

---

4. *How can list comprehension be used to replace a for loop in Python? Provide an example.*

---

5. *What does the `enumerate()` function do in the context of a for loop?*

   ---


## While Loops

1. *How do while loops in Python work? Can you provide a basic example?*

---

2. *How would you use a while loop to find the first power of 2 larger than a given number?*

---

3. *How does Python’s `break` statement work in a while loop? How about `continue`?*

---

4. *Can you write a while loop with an `else` clause and explain how it works?*

---


## General

1. *What is the difference between `break` and `continue` statements in Python?*

---

2. *How can you handle exceptions during the execution of your Python code? Can you explain the use of `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `raise`?*

---

3. *What is a “Pythonic” way to loop over two lists simultaneously?*

---

4. *Can you explain the concept of recursion? Write a simple recursive function in Python.*

---

5. *What is a generator in Python, and how does it differ from a typical function?*

---
