# Built-in Functions

  

Here are some questions to gauge your understanding of Python’s built-in functions:

1. *What is the difference between `len()`, `max()`, `min()`, and `sum()` functions?*

---

2. *How would you use the `enumerate()` function in a for loop?*

---

3. *What does the `type()` function do? Can you provide an example where it might be useful?*

---

4. *Explain how the `map()` function works. Provide an example.*

---

5. *Similarly, explain how the `filter()` function works. Provide an example.*

---

6. *What is the purpose of the `range()` function? How does it differ from `xrange()` in Python 2?*

---

7. *How does the `zip()` function work? Give an example.*

---

8. *Explain the difference between `sorted()` and `list.sort()`.*

---

9. *How can you use the `any()` and `all()` functions in Python? When might they be useful?*

---

10. *What does the `isinstance()` function do?*

---

11. *How would you use the `input()` function in a script that interacts with a user?*

---

12. *What are `ord()` and `chr()` functions? In what scenarios can they be useful?*

---

13. *What is the purpose of `globals()` and `locals()` functions?*

---

14. *How do `str()`, `int()`, `float()`, and `bool()` functions behave differently?*

---
  
15. *Explain the `eval()` function and the security implications of using it.*

---
