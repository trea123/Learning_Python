# Data Structures

Here are some potential questions to assess your understanding of Python data structures like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries:

## List

1. *How would you add an element to the end of a Python list? How about inserting it at a specific index?*

---

2. *What’s the difference between `list.pop(index)` and `del list[index]`?*

---

3. *What is list comprehension and can you provide an example of it?*

---

4. *How would you sort a list in ascending order? How about descending order?*

---

5. *How can you reverse a list in Python?*

---

6. *How can you remove duplicates from a list while preserving order?

---

7. *Describe the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in the context of lists.*

---


## Tuple

1. *How is a tuple different from a list?*

---

2. *Can you modify an element of a tuple? Explain your answer.*

---

3. *When would you use a tuple instead of a list?*

---

4. *How can you convert a tuple to a list and vice versa?    *

---

## Set

1. *What is a set in Python?*

---

2. *What are the primary use cases for a set?*

---

3. *How can you add and remove elements from a set?*

---

4. *Can you perform set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference in Python? Give examples.*

---

5. *Why can’t a set contain mutable elements like lists or dictionaries?*
   
---


## Dict (Dictionary)

1. *What is a dictionary in Python and when is it typically used?*

---

2. *How would you add a new key-value pair to a dictionary? How would you modify an existing *key-value pair?

---

3. *How can you access all keys, all values, and all key-value pairs in a dictionary?*

---

4. *How would you handle a situation where you try to access a key that doesn’t exist in a dictionary?*

---

6. *How would you merge two dictionaries?*

---

7. *Describe a situation where it might be useful to use a dictionary comprehension.*
