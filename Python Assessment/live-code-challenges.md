# Live Code Challenges

## Primitive Data Types and Built-in Functions

1. Write a function `max_of_three` that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use only primitive data types and control flow (no lists, etc.).

## List and For Loop

2. Given a list of numbers, write a list comprehension that produces a new list containing each number squared. For example, given `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output should be `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`.

## Dict and Strings

3. Write a function that takes a string and counts the occurrence of each word in the string. It should return a dictionary where the keys are the words, and the values are the counts. Ignore punctuation and make everything lowercase.

## Set

4. Write a function that takes two lists and returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes. Use set to solve this problem.

## Tuple

5. Write a function that takes a list of tuples and sorts them in increasing order by the last element in each tuple. For example, given the list `[(2, 5), (1, 1), (4, 4)]`, the output should be `[(1, 1), (4, 4), (2, 5)]`.

## Conditional Statements and Loops

6. Write a function `fib` to compute the nth Fibonacci number. For example, `fib(0) = 0`, `fib(1) = 1`, `fib(2) = 1`, `fib(3) = 2`.

## Callable Functions and Recursion

7. Write a function `sum_nested` to sum up all numbers in a nested list. The function should be able to handle lists that are nested arbitrarily deep. For example, `sum_nested([1, [2, [3, 4], 5]]) = 15`.

## Complex Task Mixing Different Concepts

8. Implement a function `find_primes(n)` that returns a list of all prime numbers less than n. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.
